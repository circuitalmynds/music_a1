00:00:54.832 --> 00:00:56.832
It's friday night and I call Gaby

00:00:56.832 --> 00:00:59.303
If she wants to roll I gotta hit up the Caddy

00:00:59.303 --> 00:01:01.500
She's always up like "Oh yes! Daddy!"

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.635
Cause she's got the booze, the bloc &amp; the "mary".

00:01:03.635 --> 00:01:05.884
Going hard its my only hobbie

00:01:05.884 --> 00:01:08.296
And if that's the way it goes I learned it from Snoop Doggy

00:01:08.296 --> 00:01:10.575
No messin' around even if they throw money

00:01:10.575 --> 00:01:12.979
And always lookin' up &amp; respectin' the homies

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.137
Homie homie, Hey hey!

00:01:15.137 --> 00:01:17.360

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.612
That bitch wants to blow up some yay

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:22.097
I'm feeling just like "Still Dre"

00:01:22.097 --> 00:01:24.179
Eh! All good! Ok!

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:26.386
Rest in peace! For my uncle Nate!

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:28.640
Always feelin' good

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.844
cause I learned everything from my Uncle Snoop

00:01:30.844 --> 00:01:33.169
The day I die they'll put me on the "cruz"

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:35.571
On my funeral spin that "Gin &amp; Juice"

00:01:35.571 --> 00:01:37.635
Everybody with caguamas and lights 

00:01:37.635 --> 00:01:39.882

Ordered me a glass a gin

00:02:02.637 --> 00:02:04.420
